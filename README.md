# placeevent-harmonia

This project uses Harmonia. Harmonia is a framework meant to serve as a foundation for every project following the React-Express-MySQL stack, as learned in Wild Code School.
It's pre-configured with a set of tools which'll help students produce industry-quality and easier-to-maintain code, while staying a pedagogical tool.
